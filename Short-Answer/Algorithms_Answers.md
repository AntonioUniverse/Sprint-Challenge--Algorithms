#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O( n )
 as the the my imput size increase the umber of number of operations increase as well.


b)O(n log n)
 as the input size grows the longer runtime will grow faster due to n being used for both loops

c)0(n)
 as the the my imput size increase the umber of number of operations increase as well.

## Exercise II

my base case would be at floor zero no eggs would be broken.
next i would want to split my array in half to have my "lowest floors " and "greater floors"
i can  could safely assume the the higher floors would break, so i wouldn't have to test that list of greater floors.
while my brokeneggs = 0 i would drop and egg on each floor which would increment my droppedeggs by 1.
when my brokeneggs = 1 i would stop on that floor which will be my f floor  and return it.

my runtime would be o(n)
